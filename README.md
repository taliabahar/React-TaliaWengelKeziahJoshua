# Should I Stay or Should I Go? 

Assignment #2 for CMSI 399 App Development Practicum Spring 2020.

Created a React Hooks web app that utilizes the Spoonacular API. Our app presents users with the variables to consider between deciding to eat out or prepare food at home in terms of health. Given a food our app presents the user with the nutritional information(calories, protein, carbs, etc.) related to the entered food for a meal one could prepare at home versus a meal they could purchase at a restaurant.
